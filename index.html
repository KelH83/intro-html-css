            <li>The cinematography is amazing</li>

            <li>The ending, **spolier** the fact that it could go either way as to whether he is still dreaming</li>
            <li>The scene where Elliot Page is first introduced to building the dream world</li>
            <li>I both like and dislike the ending, **spolier** my preference is for a final outcome but I do really appreciate how it ends just as you think the spinner will stop</li>
